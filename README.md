Simple JS App: Building a Pokedex

This is my first Javascript project. There is html, javascript, and css code. I implement jQuery and Bootstrap.

This app is linked to pokemon data. Each pokemon is shown on screen and users are able to click a button to see a modal with the details of each pokemon are printed.
